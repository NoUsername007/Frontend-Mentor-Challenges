## Frontend mentor challenges

Hey! this is a me a high school student who codes just for fun. I want to learn full stack web development to build cool web apps and to do that I need to practice my skills. So I am going to a do a ton of frontend mentor projects from now on. This is the repository where I will maintain all that code and track my progress.

Wish me luck!
